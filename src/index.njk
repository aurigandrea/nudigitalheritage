    <p class="text-center">This blog was born from the History, Heritage, and Memory module of the History course at Northeastern University London, led by Dr Andrea Kocsis, the editor of this blog. She is a member of NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks. The authors are undergraduate students taking the module, and some other scholars also happen to drop by.
