title: Is ABBA Voyage digital heritage? - New article coming soon!
description: I﻿'ve recently attended the ABBA Voyage concert and couldn't help
  to be baffled by the heritage questions it raised. This post explores how we
  can understand pop music as heritage, how to deal with the question of
  authenticity and the ethical issues of the digital 're-production' of a
  concert, whether ABBA is alive or we feel only nostalgia for it, and overall
  if the ABBA Voyage can be seen as digital heritage.
