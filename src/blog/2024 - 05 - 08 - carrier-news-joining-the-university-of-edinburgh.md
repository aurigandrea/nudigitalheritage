Although I﻿ loved mentoring undergraduates to find their passion for heritage studies at NU London, I decided to focus my career on digital research in the following years. From now on, you can [meet me at the Institute for Design Informatics](https://www.designinformatics.org/person/andrea-kocsis/) at the University of Edinburgh, where I have been a Chancellor’s Fellow in Humanities Informatics since May 2024.

But fear not, I’m still involved in heritage teaching, and you can become my student at the [brilliant Cultural Heritage Futures MSc at the Edinburgh Futures Institute](https://efi.ed.ac.uk/programmes/cultural-heritage-futures/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxeyxBhC7ARIsAC7dS3_N7uEkyPx3dThX-yji7tpFNUYH7W1Q_5yTAla9T0-0agtcbsLxIKcaAvSpEALw_wcB), where I will be surrounded by a group of ridiculously talented heritage lecturers.
