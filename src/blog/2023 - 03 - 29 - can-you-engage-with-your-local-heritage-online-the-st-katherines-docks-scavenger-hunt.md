title: Can you engage with your local heritage online? The St Katherine's Docks
  Scavenger Hunt
description: "**The big C changed everything, including forcing lecturers to
  find new ways to engage students. We wanted them to maintain the connection to
  the campus site, so I created an online scavenger hunt exploring the
  palimpsest of St Katharine's Dock, where our campus is located. Do you think I
  succeeded?**"

We found it crucial that our students at Northeastern London appreciate and understand the consequences of being situated in the historic heart of the metropolis. The space is never tabula rasa, and the spirit of the place unconsciously has an agency over us. We are linked not only to our current neighbours but also to the network of past and present experiences of living. We wanted our students to understand that - even when we couldn't be on campus physically.

So I moved our local scavenger hunt online. You are free to judge my success in overarching digital and physical spaces, but the game can still be fun. Can you accomplish the tasks while learning about the rich and sometimes difficult heritage of St Katharine's Docks?

If you would like to recreate the game in your classroom or your local area, feel free to fork the code from [here](https://github.com/aurigandrea/nuscavengerhunt). For the newbie techies, it is a front-end-only, super-easy project to practice JavaScript.

If you prefer to discover the subject but not in a gamified version, I recommend the exciting ArcGIS Storymap prepared by my colleague, Dr Olly Ayers.

And finally, if you fancy a good old cringe, I have a Youtube video on using entry-level digital tools to express better the palimpsest of history when explaining spatial heritage to students. Apologies for it, I'm clearly not an on-camera talent, but the project I am introducing, the Prague Palimpsest, is a nice one. The case study starts at about 5 minutes in.
