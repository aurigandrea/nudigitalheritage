# JAMStack Blog with Netlify CMS

 This blog was born following [Kevin Powell]'s tutorial(https://kevinpowell.co) to create a personal blog site for the [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/) DevProjects Challenge, [Create a fast and secure blog using JAMStack](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/create-a-fast-and-secure-blog-using-jamstack-c93coupnxb).
 Tutorial. But a lot of CSS, JavaScript and content later, it became the Heritage in the Digital Age Blog for Northeastern Universities students and lecturers. You can [watch this video](https://youtu.be/4wD00RT6d-g) to see how Kevin uses Eleventy, Netlify, and Netlify CMS to create a full-featured blog site built entirely with static files.
